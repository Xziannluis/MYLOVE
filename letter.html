            <h1>My Love</h1>
            <p>
                I know I haven't always been perfect, and at times, it may have seemed like I wasn’t giving enough effort. For that, I’m truly sorry. When things get tough, I sometimes think of giving up, but the truth is, I never want to lose you. I love you more than words can express, and no matter what happens, my heart always finds its way back to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You deserve all the love, care, and happiness in the world. This message may be simple, but it comes from the depths of my heart. Life may get hectic, and challenges may come our way, but my love for you will never fade. You are my happiness, my safe place, and the greatest blessing in my life. I hope you always know how much I cherish and adore you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your patience, understanding, and for loving me despite my flaws. I promise to do better, to remind you every day how much you mean to me, and to never let a day go by without showing you how much I love you .
            </p>
            <p class="text-end">
                <strong>Truly yours,</strong><br>
